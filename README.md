# flatgalaxies

Some code and notebooks from internship in Special Astrophysical Observatory of RAS.
(September 2019)

- [see](TODO) a report on PanSTARRS data as a source for new flat galaxies catalog
- explore the code written to interact with database:
  * nice-looking scatter-density [plots](TODO)
  * image fetching and adding annotations [functions](TODO)
